# Python Programming with the Pimoroni Blinkt!

![Pimoroni Blinkt](https://github.com/bgant/blinkt-scripts/blob/master/pimoroni-blinkt.jpg)

One day my 11-year-old niece said "I don't think I am smart enough to program." 

I decided to teach her and another 9-year-old niece about computers and how to program using Python. I gave each of them
a Raspberry Pi but I wanted a device to cover the 40-pin GPIO until they were ready to use it. 

The Pimoroni Blinkt! RGB LED bar was perfect. It not only protected the pins but it would also be a fun way to 
teach them programming concepts.

This repository is where I am keeping scripts and documents to teach them about programming.
